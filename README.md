# Cyber Security Base 2021

## Development environment

Requirements: recent Node

```sh
npm ci
npm run develop
```

Gatsby crashes from time to time -- if you'd like Gatsby to restart automatically, you can run `./develop-loop.sh`.

Content is in the `data` folder.

Custom markdown components are located in `src/partials`

If you want to use local, unpublished version of moocfi-quizzes for testing, run `./use-local-quizzes.sh` before running the application.
If your configuration differs from the default, add the path to the moocfi-quizzes as the first argument to the script.
An illustration of the default configuration:
```
  (parent directory)
  /                \Â 
(this repo)      [quizzes](https://github.com/rage/quizzes)
                      |
                  packages
                      |       
                  moocfi-quizzes

```
