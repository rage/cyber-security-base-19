### How to pass the course

The challenges in this CTF come in three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard.

In order to ensure everyone has a fair chance to get the first completion,
we're releasing the challenges in batches -- easy challenges are to be released on Monday (15.3.2022),
medium challenges on Tuesday (16.3.2022), and hard challenges on Friday (17.3.2022).

The exercises are published starting from 14:00, and new exercise will be added roughly every 20 minutes.

There are 10 easy challenges, 10 medium, and 3 hard.

The exercises can be found [here](https://csb-capture-the-flag.cs.helsinki.fi).
Use your MOOC account to login.

To finish a challenge, find a special code and submit it to the site.

For certain challenges, binary inspection command line tools like `strings` or
`xxd` will be useful.  Passwords will be often encoded and/or hashed and/or
encrypted. Part of the challenge is to figure out which encoding is being used.

Some of the challenges expect you to analyze and/or execute a Linux 64-bit
binary. If you have an incompatible OS consider setting up one in a VirtualBox.

To pass the CTF, you need to complete at least 8 easy challenges and at
least 7 medium challenges, before the deadline. There is no need to complete
hard challenges to pass the course.
The number of students that have completed a challenge before you has no effect on passing the course.
The deadline for completing the challenges is 30.4.2022.

Medium challenges are open after you complete 80% of easy challenges.
Hard challenges are open after you complete 80% of medium challenges.

This competition is individual work. Please do not share your solution or spoil
the exercise, let's keep the competition fair and fun for everyone! :)
