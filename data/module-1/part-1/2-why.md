Software is literally everywhere. Initially software resided on mainframes and only few people were in contact with it. Somewhat later the personal computer was invented and thanks to its popularity, software moved to our homes. (That said, in the home software was still restricted and an attacker would need physical access to the target.)

One day the Internet spawned and began globally connecting personal computers. The Internet is incredibly useful to non-attackers but it made things easier for attackers as they no longer needed to physically visit targets. The evolution of computers kept rolling on and one day we were introduced to cellular phones and eventually smart phones, which are basically small scale computers with wireless connectivity.

Currently we are on the brink of Internet of things, which promises to connect every device to the Internet. For example, we have smart TVs, smart locks, smart cars, and smart toasters. The software ranges from large, such as the operating system, to small, such as the USB driver.

There is going to be an explosion in the number of devices needing software. It has been said that by the year 2020 there will be 50 billion connections and devices. This poses a growing need for code and software developers, who will have great pressure to write both functional and secure code in a limited timeframe. Developers may face unrealistic time pressure to rush code to production.

<text-box variant="emph" name = "What about the number 50?">

50 billion seems to be too much and it seems that it is not going to be reached before 2020. But still the number of devices is staggering.

*"I think people do tend to latch onto numbers that seem really hard to
fathom," he says. "Fifty billion is pretty staggering."* - Even Evans,
[Popular Internet of Things Forecast of 50 billion devices by 2020 is Outdated.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/internet/popular-internet-of-things-forecast-of-50-billion-devices-by-2020-is-outdated)

In addition to the growing need for more code, the code base has gotten more
complex. Every machine is connected and larger systems are now distributed.
Different parts of the systems may be developed by different vendors, but need
to interoperate. Moreover, most current systems are based on software
frameworks which enlarge the code footprint of even small applications, and/or
are extensible with/via plugins and addons.

Combining the connectivity, complexity, and extensibility of the software, we
get a comfortably-sized attack surface for the attacker. It is perhaps not
surprising, therefore, that the number of vulnerabilities in software has
steadily risen over the years. Vulnerabilities and their statistics can be
queried from the National Vulnerability Database and from the Common
Vulnerability and Exposure database
([NVD statistics query page](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/statistics)
and
[CVE](http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html)).

For the attackers the attacking will stay easier than defending as long as the
attacker can attack anywhere and the latter have to defend everywhere. With a
successful security analysis, however, many of the obvious vulnerabilities --
in other words, the low hanging fruit -- can be found. This doesn't necessarily
make a system totally secure, but rather that it makes the system able to
withstand attack attempts by unskilled attackers, automated attacks.

<text-box variant="emph" name = "Vulnerabilities are hard to find">

Even though the software or/and the protocol it implements is at its mature phase it may still hold surprises. Below are some examples of some "recent" vulnerabilities found in well-known and highly-used pieces of software.

The world is changing and cyber security is a rapidly-growing global issue.
Adversaries come in many shapes and sizes, ranging from script kiddies to
foreign governments to organized crime. Regardless of the adversary, all have
easy access to very sophisticated and powerful technologies. Moreover, some
attacks are so sneaky that they become evident only after the attack has
happened.

Attacks can result in much mayhem and harm with significant monetary losses,
but the business impact of a security breach can be difficult to tell. This is
an area where it is hard to reach definitive and representative figures or
findings. At least one study, however, from [Oxford Economics](https://www.oxfordeconomics.com/my-oxford/projects/276032), provides a set of findings based on
surveys and case studies. Those findings show that cyber attacks do indeed
result in major business impact on victims.

The job of a vulnerability researcher is to come up with recommendations for
minimizing the risk to an organization. The tasks of protecting enterprise
systems and data include establishing policies, practices and tools that lower
the risk of illicit behaviour. The technical security assessments performed by
vulnerability researchers include the identification of vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and weaknesses.
